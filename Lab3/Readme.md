# Portfolio Website
This is my one-page portfolio website made using HTML and CSS.  
I built it as a part of my Web Development Lab assignment to practice Flexbox, Grid, media queries, and animations.
# Features
- Responsive layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- Flexbox used in header and hero section.
- CSS Grid used in skills and projects.
- Simple animations, hover effects, and transitions.
- Clean and easy-to-navigate one-page structure.
